    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-2 center2 black"><i class="fa fa-sitemap fa-5x"></i></div>
        <div class="col-10"><p>Omni-channel retailers provide consumers the ability to experience an entire brand, not just a segment of a brand. By utilizing brick and mortar stores as extensions of your service offering, customers can research their purchases through other channels allowing consumers the ability to tailor their shopping experience for themselves. Omni-channel retailing is made more efficient through directed marketing campaigns designed to a consumer's sensibilities. Omni-channel platforms combine a mixture of physical and digital channels, transforming historical multichannel systems into a more innovative and unified customer experience. The emergence of the omni-channel shopper requires retailers to deliver a truly positive "commerce anywhere" experience by ensuring content seamlessly flows across all channels with ease and consistency</div>

Retail e-commerce sites are a vital method of getting more value from brick and mortar stores, chain inventory, and ongoing customer loyalty. Select the right platform to suit your needs, from multi-channel interaction, to marketing and branding design, is crucial in providing customers an integrated and attractive online shopping experience. Cybernetic Retail can assist you in the design, integration and implementation of an e-commerce site that is flexible, fast and consistent.
